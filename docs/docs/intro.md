# Chainless Intro

Let's discover **Chainless in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started
Get started by **creating a new function**.  A function can either be:
- [Temporary](temporary-functions)
  The function only runs while the connection is open.  Once closed, the function disappears.
- [Persistent](persistent-functions)
  The function runs in the background on Chainless backend servers until you delete it.
